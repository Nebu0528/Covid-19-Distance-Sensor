# Covid-19-Distance-Sensor-
A Covid 19 Distance Sensor made on Arduino using C++. Made by using an LCD and an Ultrasonic Sensor to locate a person's distance and check if they are within a safe distance (read below for more information)  Information:  The Ultrasonic sensor will measure a person's distance in front or behind the wearer to see whether they are within a safe distance. If the person is more than 2.5 meters away, the Green LED will turn on and display on the LCD that they are within a safe distance. If the person is less than 2.5 meters but more than 2 meters it will turn on the Yellow LED and indicate a Caution warning on the LCD. If the person is less than 2 meters, it will turn on the Red LED and activate a piezo to indicate that the person is too close as well as displaying a Caution warning on the LCD.
